📌 Overview
This project analyzes waiting times for inpatient and outpatient services from 2018 to 2021. Using Power BI, we visualized and analyzed key metrics like the mean and median waiting times to uncover trends and insights. PowerPoint was used to design professional backgrounds and presentations, ensuring the findings are clear and impactful.

🛠 Tools and Technologies
Power BI: For data analysis and creating interactive dashboards.
PowerPoint: To create custom visuals for storytelling.
Excel/CSV: For managing and preprocessing raw data.
Python/Excel (Optional): Any additional preprocessing steps if applicable.

📊 Project Goals
Calculate average waiting times using mean and median.
Visualize trends in waiting times across four years (2018–2021).
Identify seasonal patterns and service inefficiencies.
Provide actionable recommendations to reduce peak wait times.

📈 Visuals
We have taken some screenshots to give some example of our work and some interesting results

📝 Future Work
Expand the analysis to include additional factors like demographics and time of day.
Automate data updates using Power BI's scheduling feature.
Explore advanced statistical methods to model waiting time distributions.
